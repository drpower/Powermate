            <h2>Home Delivery</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Your home must be accessible by tractor-trailer and someone must be home to accept delivery. A driveway is considered “accessible” if it a) has no overhanging trees, b) has no power lines, c) contains no culverts or bridges, and d) will allow the truck to make a full turn-around. If the driveway isn’t accessible the delivery will be made at the base of the driveway.</li>
              <li>The truck driver is not required to unload your shipment. Additional fees may apply if the driver unloads your machine. (If you MUST have the machine unloaded for you, please select the Liftgate Service option.) </li>
              <li>On the day of delivery, we recommend you have a couple of sturdy 10-foot planks (2" thick x 10" wide) plus 1-2 helpers to assist you in unloading your machine. </li>

              <li>After we process your order and it leaves our factory, the freight company will call you to schedule a delivery time. The carrier will usually provide a 3-4 hour delivery window (for example, 8am to Noon). </li>
