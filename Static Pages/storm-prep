<h2>Storm Preparedness Checklist:  </h2>
<ul>
<li>Create an emergency backup power plan for the possibility of extended outages

</li>
<li>Create an emergency evacuation plan
</li>
<li>Talk to your family about a safe location in your home for waiting out a severe storm

</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with how to safely operate a generator – keeping it the recommended distance from livable space when in operation, and in a highly ventilated area
</li>
<li>Check your yard for safety hazards – put away equipment and secure lawn furniture and plants that could be damaged by heavy winds

</li>

<li>Have an emergency supply kit ready with snacks, drinking water, first aid supplies, flashlights and batteries.
</li>
<li>Fill gas cans and have them ready to power your portable generator
</li>
<li>Make sure cellphones and electronics are fully charged ahead of time
</li>
<li>Plan ahead when it comes to getting last minute food supplies, as everyone will likely be grabbing last minute items at the same time

</li>
