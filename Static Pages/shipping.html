          <p>
              <strong>Standard Shipping</strong>: Items under 150 lbs, that are not irregular in shape
              or size, will be delivered by UPS or USPS. See the chart in the
              Standard Shipping section below.
          </p>


          <p>
              <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>: Certain items may be subject to additional charges
              related to size, weight, or hazardous material restrictions. Shipping
              and handling charges are subject to change without notice.
          </p>


          <p>
              <strong>Delivery Time</strong>: The shipping estimates displayed on
              product pages (example: “Ships in 1 to 3 Business Days”) indicate when
              we expect the product to ship from our factory, not when you will
              receive it. Transit time will vary depending on the product, the
              shipment method, and your location. If we are unable, for any reason,
              to ship in the estimated timeframe, we will contact you by email. Once
              the product ships, you will receive a shipping confirmation email that
              will allow you to track your shipment.
          </p>


          <p>
              <strong>Rush Delivery</strong>: Expedited delivery is available for selected items.
              Please see the Standard shipping chart for shipping details and
              charges. Rush delivery is not available for items shipped via motor
              freight. Most expedited shipments arrive within 2 business days of when
              they ship from our warehouse (not from the date item is ordered).
          </p>


          <p>
              <strong>Changes to Delivery After Shipment</strong>: Any request to change the delivery
              address or type of delivery service that is made after your product
              ships will be subject to a re-consignment fee. If you request a
              re-consignment, we will obtain a quote from the carrier and get your
              approval before finalizing the re-consignment and charging you for it.
          </p>


          <p>
              <strong>Returns</strong>: If a product is returned, customer is responsible for normal
              shipping charges from their delivery address. Please visit our <a href="/support/returns">Returns
              page</a> for more information.

              Motor Freight Shipping
          </h2>


          <p>
              Items over 150 lbs. are shipped via motor freight due to their size and
              weight. We offer four delivery tiers for items shipped via motor
              freight. See the shipping charges listed in the shipping tab of each
              product’s description page. If ordering online, you will be prompted to
              choose your preferred delivery option during checkout. Note that rush
              delivery is not available for items shipped via motor freight.
          </p>
