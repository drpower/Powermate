            inadvertently taken will be promptly refunded, and is it is our policy not to charge you for an order until the product is shipped.

        <h2>IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>
            Due to a recent ruling by the US Supreme Court, effective July 1, 2018, businesses conducting internet sales and phone sales are now required to collect sales tax in states that have enacted such laws. Sales tax will be
            collected based on the state the product was delivered and will be remitted back to the same state. States without such laws may require us to send you and the State notification of your purchases at year end, as well as remind
            you of the obligation to pay any sales tax due with your personal income tax return. Sales tax exemptions can only be requested by submission of a valid sales tax exemption certificate issued by your State tax department in
            advance to Powermate, 800 Hinesburg Road, VT 05403. Sorry no exceptions.
